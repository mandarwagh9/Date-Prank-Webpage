# Date Prank Website

## Overview

This project creates a playful webpage that asks the user, "Will you go on a date with me?" The page features two buttons: "Yes" and "No." When the user tries to click the "No" button, it moves slightly, making it difficult to click. If the user clicks the "Yes" button, they are redirected to the page with time and location for the date.

## Features

- **Dynamic Button Movement**: The "No" button moves to a nearby position when hovered over, making it hard to click.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The movement of the "No" button includes smooth transitions for a better user experience.
- **Redirection**: Clicking the "Yes" button redirects the user to a different webpage.
